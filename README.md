# Plain Python event-based spiking neural network simulator
A very basic event-based spiking network simulator that I built to dive deeper into the actor model and event-based spiking networks simulation strategies.

File 'main.py' contains code of simple simulation of recursively randomly connected integrate-and-fire population with STDP.

Here shown activity plot of simulated neural network.
