# Plain Python event-based spiking neural network simulator
A very basic event-based spiking network simulator that I built to dive deeper into the actor model and event-based spiking networks simulation strategies.

File 'main.py' contains code of simple simulation of 2 randomly connected integrate-and-fire populations with STDP.

Here shown simulated network's first group activity
